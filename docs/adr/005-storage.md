## Summary
Define a storage strategy that allows the FitMind AI mobile app to work offline, support cross-device sync, and secure personal data, while meeting tight MVP deadlines.

## Issue
We need to support offline workouts and cross-device sync in an environment with intermittent connectivity, while also enabling long-term scalability and secure data handling.

## Decision
Hybrid storage combining local storage (AsyncStorage) and remote backend (MongoDB Atlas) with periodic sync.

## Status
Accepted

## Details
 # Assumptions
‚Ä¢	Users expect offline access to workout content.
‚Ä¢	Data must be synchronized securely across devices.
‚Ä¢	The backend uses MongoDB Atlas for persistent storage.
‚Ä¢	We must handle sensitive health-related user data.
‚Ä¢	Real-time sync is not required in MVP, but offline support is.
 # Constraints
‚Ä¢	Project Timeline 
‚Ä¢	App must work reliably in low-connectivity environments.
‚Ä¢	No real-time sync architecture due to time constraints.
 # Positions: Comparative Analysis
Option	Pros	Cons
Remote Storage Only	- Centralized data
- Simplified analytics
- Scalable	- No offline access
- High latency
- Poor UX in poor signal
Local Storage Only	- Very fast
- Works offline
- Easy to implement	- No sync
- No backups
- Risk of data loss
Hybrid (Chosen)	- Offline-first UX
- Sync + backup support
- Balanced model	- Requires sync/conflict logic
- Dual-layer security complexity
None (Memory only)	- Extremely fast
- Zero infra	- Data lost on app exit
- Useless for persistent features

## Argument
Hybrid storage offers the best compromise for our use case. Local AsyncStorage provides fast, offline-first access, while remote MongoDB storage ensures persistence and cross-device functionality. Sync logic can be optimized over time, but even a simple push/pull strategy supports MVP goals.

## Implications
 # Positive
‚Ä¢	Smooth offline experience
‚Ä¢	Reliable cloud backup and sync
‚Ä¢	Responsive UI from local caching
‚Ä¢	Scalability for future growth
 # Negative
‚Ä¢	Increased complexity due to sync conflicts
‚Ä¢	Security and validation needed in both layers
‚Ä¢	Extra testing for sync scenarios

## Related Decisions
‚Ä¢	ADR: Choose Backend Database

## Related Requirements
‚Ä¢	Support for offline workouts and progress logging
‚Ä¢	Cross-device data sync
‚Ä¢	Secure handling of health data

## Related Artifacts
‚Ä¢	Sync logic spec document
‚Ä¢	AsyncStorage wrapper module
‚Ä¢	MongoDB data sync APIs

## Related Principles
‚Ä¢	Offline-first design
‚Ä¢	User data safety and ownership
‚Ä¢	Scalable-by-default

## Notes
Syncing will initially be periodic (e.g., on app open/close or manual trigger), with conflict resolution based on timestamps or client priority.
