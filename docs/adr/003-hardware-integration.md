## Summary

We need to determine which native hardware features to integrate into the **FitMind AI** mobile app. These features support core app functionality such as real-time fitness tracking, personalized activity suggestions, audio guidance during workouts and meditation, and secure user access.

---

## Issue

The app must use device hardware to enhance the fitness experience, but we must be selective given time, battery, and privacy considerations. Hardware features under consideration include:

- **GPS**: for location-based activity tracking and suggestions
- **Speaker**: to provide guided workouts and meditation audio
- **Camera**: for capturing progress photos
- **Accelerometer**: for step/activity detection
- **Battery optimization** strategies
- **Fingerprint Scanner**: for secure login

---

## Decision

We will integrate:

- **GPS**: for real-time location tracking
- **Speaker**: for audio guidance during sessions
- **Camera**: to support optional progress photos
- **Accelerometer**: for passive fitness tracking

We will not include:

- **Fingerprint Scanner**, due to complexity and limited benefit in the MVP phase

---

## Status

‚úÖ **Accepted (Final)**

---

## Assumptions

- React Native supports access to device sensors and modules such as GPS, camera, and audio.
- Users will be engaging in real-world physical activity, so sensor integration is crucial to enhance motivation and personalization.
- Security can be initially handled with passcodes or session tokens rather than biometric authentication.

---

## Constraints

Battery efficiency is critical. Integration must not drain resources or hinder performance. Fingerprint scanner setup requires platform-specific code and offers limited MVP value. Privacy considerations must be met when using the camera or location.

---

## Positions: Comparative Analysis

### GPS

- ‚úÖ Pros: Enables location-aware workouts and activity logs
- ‚ùå Cons: Continuous use can drain battery

### Speaker

- ‚úÖ Pros: Offers motivational audio and meditation cues
- ‚ùå Cons: Must ensure compatibility with other audio sources (e.g., music)

### Camera

- ‚úÖ Pros: Allows visual progress tracking
- ‚ùå Cons: Raises privacy concerns; should be opt-in

### Accelerometer

- ‚úÖ Pros: Useful for passive motion tracking (e.g., steps)
- ‚ùå Cons: Data interpretation may require fine-tuning

### Fingerprint Scanner

- ‚úÖ Pros: High security, user-friendly
- ‚ùå Cons: Non-essential for MVP, complex native implementation

### Battery Optimization

- ‚úÖ Needed across all features to prevent excessive consumption and maintain user satisfaction

---

## Argument

**GPS** and the **speaker** are essential to the core user experience, enabling real-time fitness tracking and audio-guided coaching.  
**Camera** and **accelerometer** add useful, optional functionality.  
**Fingerprint authentication** is a luxury feature at this stage.  
Battery optimization will be handled by limiting background polling and using event-driven triggers.

---

## Implications

These features increase app engagement and personalization.  
The choice to exclude the fingerprint scanner reduces complexity, avoids delays in cross-platform implementation, and aligns with our MVP priorities.

---

## Related Decisions

- Development Framework: React Native (must support native modules)
- Database: Remote + local (stores photos, logs, sensor data)

---

## Related Requirements

- Real-time activity tracking
- Audio-guided sessions
- Privacy-aware photo logging
- Light battery usage

---

## Related Artifacts

- `services/LocationService.js`
- `services/AudioService.js`
- `services/PhotoCapture.js`
- `utils/ActivityTracker.js`

---

## Related Principles

- User-centered design
- Privacy by default
- MVP-first delivery
- Low-power design

---

## Notes

Accelerometer integration will begin in phase 2.  
Battery-saving settings will be user-configurable.  
Biometric login can be explored post-MVP using `react-native-fingerprint-scanner`.
