## Summary  
We need to choose a cross-platform mobile app development framework for building **FitMind AI**, targeting Android devices with potential iOS scalability. The team wants rapid development, native hardware access (e.g., GPS, speaker), responsive performance, and compatibility with AI SDKs. The framework must also align with the team's current technical skillset in JavaScript.

## Issue  
The framework must enable:
- Seamless development for Android (and optionally iOS),
- Efficient component reuse,
- Integration with native device features (e.g., GPS, audio),
- AI-powered functionality via external APIs (e.g., OpenAI),
- Modern UI styling using Bootstrap.

We must decide between:
- React Native  
- Ionic  
- Cordova  
- (Other candidates: NativeScript, Framework7 – eliminated early due to team experience and complexity)

## Decision  
✅ We have chosen **React Native** as the mobile development framework for FitMind AI.

## Status  
**Decided (Final)**

## Details

### Assumptions  
- The app must be Android compatible and potentially scalable to iOS.  
- The team is familiar with JavaScript/TypeScript.  
- Native device features and responsive UI are critical.  
- The app will access cloud APIs and local device storage.  
- The app must be maintainable post-submission and portfolio-ready.  

### Constraints  
- 10-week timeline with a small 3-member team.  
- Learning curve and complexity must be minimized.  
- Bootstrap is required for styling.  
- The app must support offline use.  

### Positions: Comparative Analysis

| Framework      | Pros                                                                                          | Cons                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **React Native** | - True native performance using compiled code  <br> - Rich UI & animations <br> - Strong community, Facebook support <br> - Compatible with AI and ML SDKs <br> - Excellent with device sensors | - Slightly steeper learning than Ionic <br> - Debugging native issues may require extra setup |
| **Ionic**         | - Web-based (uses HTML/CSS/JS) <br> - Easier for web devs <br> - Has UI components <br> - Great for rapid prototyping | - Relies on WebView = slower performance <br> - Not ideal for complex hardware features |
| **Cordova**       | - Simple to set up <br> - Works with web languages <br> - Huge plugin library | - Performance bottlenecks <br> - WebView-based UX <br> - Outdated compared to modern tools |
| **NativeScript**  | - Full native access <br> - Good for advanced UI <br> - Strong performance | - Complex learning curve <br> - Smaller community <br> - Limited team familiarity |
| **Framework7**    | - Pretty UIs <br> - Fast for simple apps | - Web-focused <br> - Poor integration with native features & AI SDKs |

## Argument

React Native offers the best tradeoff between:
- **Performance** (native rendering),
- **Functionality** (GPS, audio, AI),
- **Productivity** (hot reloading, shared components),
- **Team Skill Fit** (JS/TS proficiency),
- **Community & Ecosystem** (plugins, docs, tools).

Compared to Ionic and Cordova, React Native:
- Delivers near-native performance without relying on a WebView engine. [Pagepro](https://pagepro.co/blog/react-native-vs-ionic-and-cordova-comparison/)  
- Handles hardware integration and animations more smoothly. [Back4App](https://blog.back4app.com/ionic-vs-cordova-vs-react-native/)  
- Is more future-proof due to active community and support by Meta. [MindK](https://www.mindk.com/blog/react-native-vs-ionic-phonegap-cordova/)  

Ionic and Cordova are better suited for simpler apps or teams with strong HTML/CSS backgrounds but suffer from performance limitations due to their web-centric architecture. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ionic-vs-cordova-react-native-choosing-right-framework-sunita-thakur-rsxdc/)  

NativeScript was ruled out due to complexity and lack of team familiarity.

Ionic and Cordova fall short on performance and native hardware integration. NativeScript is powerful but exceeds our project complexity budget.

## Implications  
- React Native enables the app to be fast, modern, and modular.  
- Easier integration of sensors, maps, audio, and AI APIs.  
- Bootstrap components can be styled using `react-native-bootstrap-styles`.  
- Enables shared codebase for iOS in the future, without significant rework.  

## Related Decisions  
- CSS framework: Bootstrap  
- Navigation: React Navigation  
- Hardware: GPS, Speaker  
- Backend: Node.js/Express  

## Related Requirements  
- Real-time workout tracking  
- Personalized AI-based fitness plans  
- Secure local and remote storage  
- Modern user experience  

## Related Artifacts  
- `App.js`, `Navigation.js`, `screens/`, `components/`  
- NPM packages: `react-navigation`, `react-native-bootstrap-styles`, `react-native-maps`

## Related Principles  
- Simplicity over complexity  
- Speed of delivery  
- Performance and UX first  
- Code reusability and maintainability  

## Notes  
- Team will use Expo initially for fast prototyping, then migrate to React Native CLI if needed for native modules.  
- React Native allows future integration of wearables and sensors if app evolves.
